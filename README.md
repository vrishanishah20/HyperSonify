# HyperSonify
For the Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2023, we worked on 'Immersed in the Sounds of Space', our task was the 
sonification of 3D images, hyperspectral images, to understand data. we made the conversion is a way that pitch of audio corresponds to intensity of image pixels.
Higher intensity(255=white) produces higher pitch whereas lower intensity(0=black) produces negligible sound. The web application was hosted on Vercel. It visualizes the image and the sound simultaneously which gives us a better understanding of the image. 

The main objective behind this project is to help the visually impaired understand space images using sound. 
An added bonus is making the viewing of space fun, you could say we are literally listening to light!

This technology could also be used to understand other 3d images of plant health, CT scans, water components etc.
